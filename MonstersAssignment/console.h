/**
\class	Console

\brief	This class is designed to wrap around built in console functions
		Note: it is a windows only implementation and will not work within a Linux based OS

		Functions included are:
		- clear			: Clears the entire console buffer with the space character
		- pause			: Asks the user to enter any character to continue
		- gotoXY		: Moves the cursor to the XY location within the console
		- setTitle		: Sets the title of the console
		- setSize		: Sets the size of the console window (pixels)
		- setPosition	: Sets the position of the console window (pixels)
		- getSize		: Gets the size of the console window (pixels)	
		- getPosition	: Gets the position of the console window (pixels)
